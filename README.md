## You can always count on me when...


You need someone to help you with your code.


You need to talk to someone.


You just want to have a good laugh.

## A funny story


When I was a kid, I secretly broke my Playstation 2 hoping to get a Playstation 3.<br>
My parents bought me a new Playstation 2...


#### TL;DR


I am an idiot.
